    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <hr>
    <h4>&lt;Clockwork&gt; is a progression-oriented raiding guild on US-Sargeras. We started as a group of casual raiders in Cataclysm, but some of us have been playing together since TBC. &lt;Clockwork&gt; strives to efficiently raid the newest content on a light schedule of only 8 hours a week. We have a laid-back atmosphere in raiding, but that doesn't mean we don't take progression seriously. We pride ourselves on learning bosses quickly and killing them in a reasonable amount of pulls. We are always respectful of each other and have zero tolerance for drama. We all play for fun and are always seeking new players with a similar mindset.</h4>

    <h2>Schedule</h2>
    <hr>
    <h4>We raid two nights per week, four hours a night as part of our mandatory raiding schedule. We expect very good attendance from our raiders (90%+) and at least some notice if you will be absent. We also do normal or alt runs on other days of the week when people are free for fun.
